Sample: simpleD3D9Texture
Minimum spec: SM 3.5

Simple program which demonstrates Direct3D9 Texture interoperability with CUDA.  The program creates a number of D3D9 Textures (2D, 3D, and CubeMap) which are written to from CUDA kernels. Direct3D then renders the results on the screen.  A Direct3D capable device is required.

Key concepts:
Graphics Interop
Texture
