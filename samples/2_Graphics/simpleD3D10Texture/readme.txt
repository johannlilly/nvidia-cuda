Sample: simpleD3D10Texture
Minimum spec: SM 3.5

Simple program which demonstrates how to interoperate CUDA with Direct3D10 Texture.  The program creates a number of D3D10 Textures (2D, 3D, and CubeMap) which are generated from CUDA kernels. Direct3D then renders the results on the screen.  A Direct3D10 Capable device is required.
