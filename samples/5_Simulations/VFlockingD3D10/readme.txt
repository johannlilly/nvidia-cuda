Sample: VFlockingD3D10
Minimum spec: SM 3.5

The sample models formation of V-shaped flocks by big birds, such as geese and cranes. The algorithms of such flocking are borrowed from the paper "V-like formations in flocks of artificial birds" from Artificial Life, Vol. 14, No. 2, 2008. The sample has CPU- and GPU-based implementations. Press 'g' to toggle between them. The GPU-based simulation works many times faster than the CPU-based one. The printout in the console window reports the simulation time per step. Press 'r' to reset the initial distribution of birds.
